# domani

domani is a Javascript DOM manipulation library inspired by JQuery. It allows users to select, traverse, and create DOM elements, as well as create `DOMNodeCollection` objects using HTML5. It also simplifies HTML requests and processes them with an asynchronous queue.

## Getting Started

To use domani, simply download the library into a preexisting project and include the webpack output `domani.js` in your source code.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/reset.css">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="../domani.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
```
